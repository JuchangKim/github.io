    <h2>Brief Explanations of Projects &amp; Research</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>HireHub (React, Node, MongoDB):</strong> A full-stack job-hunting platform featuring secure user authentication with JWT, CRUD for job postings, real-time search filters, and mobile-responsive design.  
      <br /><br />

      <strong>Poker Game (Java, OOP, Derby Database):</strong> A GUI-based card game with multiple computer players, leveraging embedded Derby DB for data persistence. It uses strong OOP principles and a custom MVC design pattern for maintainability.  
      <br /><br />

      <strong>Phone Virus Simulation (Java, Concurrency):</strong> Simulates a network of phones becoming infected by a virus, showcasing multithreading, synchronization for repair shop.  
      <br /><br />

      <strong>Path Finder (Java, Data Structures):</strong> A maze-like traversal system built on a binary tree representation. It uses recursion and stack-based traversal (DFS-like) to find the exit in the maze.  
      <br /><br />

      <strong>Foundation of Data Science (Python):</strong> Explores data visualization, pre-processing, feature selection, and classification models (Naive Bayes, KNN, ANN), employing EDA techniques and model evaluation metrics.  
      <br /><br />

      <strong>Data Analysis (Python):</strong> Focuses on regression analysis (linear, OLS) with hypothesis testing, correlation heatmaps, and assumption checks (normality, homoscedasticity).  
      <br /><br />

      <strong>Algorithm Research (Python, Currency Exchange):</strong> Investigates Bellman-Ford and Floyd-Warshall algorithms for directed graphs modeling currency exchange rates, including handling negative edge weights and detecting arbitrage opportunities.
